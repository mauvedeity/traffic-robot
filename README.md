# README

This project is my traffic robot. All it does is fetch traffic data from
the [Traffic England](http://www.trafficengland.com/) web site, filter
out the bits I might be interesgted in, and then push the results to my
phone via [Pushover](http://www.pushover.net/). I built this to scratch
my own itch, and so it's really not a good example of anything. I'm
putting it up here in the vague hope that I might actually do proper
versioning on it, rather than having lots of files with a date in the
filename. Do let me know if it's any use to you.

NB: There are *many* things hardwired into the code. I'm working
on removing this stuff as I find it. Like I said, this is vaguely
productionised version of something I built to be a MVP for me, and then
welded a few other bits on.  Sorry about that.

## Dependencies

I use a library called [`chump`](https://github.com/karanlyons/chump) to
do the actual talking to Pushover. It seems to fail occasionally, but
I don't know why. I should probably fix that.

## Support files

| File                       | Purpose                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app-api-key.example        | Your actual Pushover App API key goes in here                                                   |
| lastguid.example           | The code stores the last GUID seen in a file called `lastguid.txt` to prevent duplicate alerts  |
| trafficrobot-users.example | User details (user API keys and so on) stored in `trafficrobot-users.txt` to be used for alerts |

Further documentation is in the files themselves. NB: they should have
the extension `.example` replaced with `.txt` to run. Or you could edit
the `get_fileloc` function which does the mapping from internal reference
to file name.  But I'd suggest putting the correct stuff in files called
`something.txt`, using the `.example` ones as templates.

## Pushover

See the instuctions at [the Pushover website](http://www.pushover.net/)
for more information on how to configure Pushover for your requirements.
It is not a free service, but for individuals you can just buy the app
on whatever platform you want, and it's then free to use after that. See
[their pricing page](https://pushover.net/pricing) for details.

## Chump

Chump is also on github [here](https://github.com/karanlyons/chump).
It needs two keys to use, which you can get from Pushover. I've
removed my API keys from this version - you'll need to substitute
yours to make it work for you.

I have had some problems with Chump, but then I haven't tested
against the latest version, so I should probably do that.

See
[the instructions in that project](https://github.com/karanlyons/chump).
for information on how to set Chump up.
